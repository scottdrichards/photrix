# Photrix
A modern way to enjoy your photos. Think the functionality of LightRoom, the reliability of your local storage, the ease of use of your phone gallery, and the AI of Google.

Mission:

  - find pictures he or she knows exists
  - discover forgotten pictures
  - share pictures with friends, family, and others

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm 9+
- PostgreSQL (for production use)

### Development Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm run install:all`
3. Copy environment file: `cp server/.env.example server/.env`
4. Start development servers: `npm run dev`

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001
- Health Check: http://localhost:3001/api/health

## General Interaction
User can upload a photo through convenient web techniques such as drag and drop, file system access api, etc. The client device resizes the image to a moderate resolution before sending. The server than indexes the files, saves it, and saves a thumbnail.

The general layout of the application is a menu bar for sign-out etc. at top, below that is a collapsable filter panel. Below that, and the main page is the thumbnail viewer. At the bottom of the screen is a details panel that shows details for a currently selected image (or images). There's a button to enter full-screen mode to show the currently selected image.

## Index
The system will index a photo by date taken, geolocation, ratings, favorites, keywords, caption, camera make, camera model, camera lens, etc. These can be filtered as well. For example, the filter panel will include a map view of all pictures currently shown. The system will generate AI tags for the images as part of the index. Facial recognition will be employed to help find pictures of people.

## Sharing
A user can select a collection of photos or a filter set, and share those with a particular email address. 
for example, a user could share all pictures during a certain time period and place with someone. Or the person can share all pictures with a particular face in them.

## Current Status
ðŸš§ **Project Restart in Progress** - The application is being rebuilt from scratch with modern technologies.

See [MASTER PLAN.MD](./MASTER%20PLAN.MD) for the complete implementation roadmap.
